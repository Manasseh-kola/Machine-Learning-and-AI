# Smart-Glasses
Smart-Glasses with face-recogition and obstacle detection features.
The algorithms for both features were ran on a Raspberry pi 4

#Face recogntion
Images and video frames were captured using a Raspberry Pi camera and OpenCV.
Faces in captured images or video frames were detected using histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and linear Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Faces were recognition with the use of a deep neural network

#Obstacle detection
The obstacle detection feature was realized with the use of an ultrasonic sensor and python codes.
